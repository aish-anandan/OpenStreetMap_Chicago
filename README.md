# OpenStreetMap_Chicago
The purpose of this project is to wrangle XML data for Chicago from the OpenStreetMap project and make it suitable for insertion into MongoDB. Once inserted in MongoDB, we can leverage MongoDB's geographical indexes to develop an application simialr to Google Map's "Find near me".

The code in AmenityFinder assumes that there is a MongoDB server installed on the system.
